# Poem Generator by Mazin Abubeker
# Project for GSVlabs

Hello!

To open the project, you can simply navigate to this URL I hosted for this repository:
https://mazinabubeker.github.io/Poem-Generator/

If you would like to run the project locally, simply download all of the repository files (5 files: index.html, poems_style.css, poems_app.js, create_style.css, create_app.js), put them into a folder on your system, and open index.html.

Enjoy!


---- Some context ----

- This app was created with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript
- This app was built mainly with desktop use in mind (not mobile)
- No external libraries were used (e.g. Bootstrap)
- All components and designs were made by me, so no citations are needed
