# Poem Generator by Mazin Abubeker
# Project for GSVlabs

Hello!

To open the project, you can simply navigate to this URL I hosted for this repository:
https://mazinabubeker.github.io/Poem-Generator/

If you would like to run the project locally, simply download all of the repository files (5 files: index.html, poems_style.css, poems_app.js, create_style.css, create_app.js), put them into a folder on your system, and open index.html.

Enjoy!

---- How to use ----

- The "new" button allows you to create a new custom poem (use singular base-form words!)
- The "clear" button will clear all poems in the database, feel free to use this!
- The "test" button will add a test poem to the database in order to save time from having to create numerous new poems
- Pressing on a poem will expand the card to view the full poem (if necessary)



---- Some context ----

- This app was created with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript
- This app was built mainly with desktop use in mind (not mobile)
- No external libraries were used (e.g. Bootstrap)
- All components and designs were made by me, so no citations are needed
- Chrome is recommended, but not required! :)
