# Poem Generator by Mazin Abubeker
# Project for GSVlabs

Hello!

To open the project, you can simply navigate to this URL I hosted for this repository:
https://mazinabubeker.github.io/Poem-Generator/

If you would like to run the project locally, simply download all of the repository files (5 files: index.html, poems_style.css, poems_app.js, create_style.css, create_app.js), put them into a folder on your system, and open index.html.

Enjoy!
